<template>
  <div>
    <div>Course.vue in page directory</div>
    <NuxtPage />
    <p>
      Main trick is here is <strong>NuxtApp</strong> <br />
      because of it i can see further pages under the same root <br />
      if i go to the further route, i will see that i have elements of /course
      root
    </p>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup></script>
