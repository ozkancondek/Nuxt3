=>HMR(Hot Module reloading) = nuxt understand any changes in app(template ort page) and render in browser immediately.But if u delete or add some files, maybe u can start dev server again

=>open vue dev console and see all routes

=> thoose are my roots
/ (pages/index.vue) => here is main root
/course (page/course.vue) =>here is my course route in page directory
/course/lesson (pages/course/lesson) =>i created a seperated folder (course) But
i still have course.vue route in page directory. So if i add to <NuxtApp> to the course.vue
thats mean i can also see course.vue page index in course/lesson route
wit adding NuxtPage iam saying that, it will be visible everything also in child routes which are countinue with same route name
